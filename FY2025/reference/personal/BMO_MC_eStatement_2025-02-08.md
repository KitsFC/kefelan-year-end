**Important information about your BMO credit card account**

**Interest charges and calculation:** The interest rates we charge are
shown on your account statement and card carrier. For information on how
we calculate interest charges, refer to your BMO Cardholder Agreement
(the "agreement") available at bmo.com/cha

**Interest-free grace period:** If you pay your balance due in full (or
your total balance for customers with interest-bearing installment
plans) by the payment due date, any purchases, installment plans (for
customers with interest-bearing installment plans) and fees appearing on
your account statement for the first time will have an interest-free
grace period of at least 21 days. Otherwise, we will charge interest
retroactively from the date of each purchase, installment plan
conversion (for customers with interest-bearing installment plans) or
fee until the date we receive payment in full. There is no interest-free
grace period on balance transfers, or cash advances, including cash-like
transactions and gaming transactions. If you do not pay your balance due
in full, your grace period will increase to at least 25 days on your
next monthly statement. Your grace period will return to at least 21
days once you pay your balance due in full by the next payment due date.

**Your minimum payment if you reside outside Quebec:**

Your minimum payment will be \$10.00 plus any interest plus any fees
(excluding installment plan interest and fees) plus any total monthly
installment plan payments plus the greater of the following: (i) any
amount past due on your account statement; or (ii) any amount by which
your total balance exceeds your credit limit. If your balance due is
\$10.00 or less, you must pay the full amount.

**Your minimum payment if you reside within Quebec:**

If your credit card account was opened on or after August 1, 2019, the
following minimum payment terms apply: Your minimum payment will be the
greater of the following:(i) any total monthly installment plan
payments, plus 5.00% of your balance due (excluding any installment plan
payments) plus any amount past due on your account statement; or (ii)
any amount by which your total balance exceeds your credit limit; or
(iii) \$10.00. If your balance due is \$10.00 or less, you must pay the
full amount.

If your credit card account was opened before August 1, 2019, the
following minimum payment terms apply: Your minimum payment will be the
greater of the following:(i) any total monthly installment plan
payments, plus 4.50% of your balance due (excluding any installment plan
payments) plus any amount past due on your account statement; or (ii)
any amount by which your total balance exceeds your credit limit; or
(iii) \$10.00. If your balance due is \$10.00 or less, you must pay the
full amount. These terms will remain in effect until your July 2025
statement. Starting on your August 2025 statement, the percentage will
increase to 5.00%.

**How we apply payments to your account:** When we receive a payment, we
apply it to your account as outlined in your agreement. Your payments
are processed the day we receive them. You must make sure that we
receive your payment on or before the payment due date shown on your
account statement.

**Foreign currency conversion:** The exchange rate for converting
foreign currency transactions to Canadian dollars (for Canadian dollar
cards) and to U.S. dollars (for U.S. dollar cards) is the rate charged
to us by the payment network on the date the transaction is posted to
your account plus 2.50% for purchases and minus 2.50% for refunds.

**Disputes:** Report any items which do not agree with your records
within 30 days of your statement date. For your convenience, you can
also check your recent transactions at bmo.com/onlinebanking or via BMO
Mobile Banking.

**If you are moving to or out of Quebec:** There will be changes to your
terms and conditions. Please review the minimum payment details on this
page and refer to your agreement available at bmo.com/cha

> 1 Includes: credit card cheques (if applicable), cash-like
